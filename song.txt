BONES
Gimme gimme gimme some time to think
I’m in the bathroom looking at me
Face in the mirror is all I need
Wait until the reaper takes my life
Never gonna get me out alive
I will live a thousand million lives

My patience is waning
Is this entertaining?
My patience is waning
Is this entertaining?

I got this feeling yeah you know
Where I’m losing all control
Cause there’s magic in my bones
I got this feeling in my soul
Go ahead and throw your stones
Cause there’s magic in my bones
